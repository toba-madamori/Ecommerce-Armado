# ARMADO ECOMMERCE WEB APPLICATION 


#### Motivation

My motivation for this project was mainly to push myself farther than I had ever gone before as a self- taught   software developer. Before working on this project I had only ever worked on smaller sample projects and while I learnt something from each of them I had never really gone out of my comfort zone.

Building this project served to push me ahead and also  the project provides a real world solution to the problem of product shopping, especially in these times where it seems everything has gone virtual and is now done over the internet without the need to step out.

The most important thing I learnt here was mainly the fact that while we as developer’s love to build exciting stuff, we must never forget that at the end of the day we are building for real people and so we have to make the project as accessible and easily understood as possible.

Also I had to learn to sit back and actually plan, draw schema’s and write out project todo’s  that sketched out the whole project in a wide overview before actually setting out to code to minimize the number of mistakes I made earlier on and also to help me foresee roadblocks and issue’s that might crop up later in the process.

#### Project Description:
This application allows prospective users(buyers) to go  through the available products right from the landing page/home page without having to sign-up or register. In the event a user sees what they like and want to add it to their cart then they are finally required to register.

Having to register is in the long run for the benefit of the user, since it enables the application to keep track of whatever the user has added to their favorites, added to their cart and also the ability to write reviews.

This application makes use of the  Django  web framework  and a free responsive template from Colorlib

Why Django?

- Django enables fast development from concept idea to built product
- With Django you can always start small and then scale out later(easily scalable )
- Django works with independent components and so you have the option to plug and unplug anything depending on your needs(Easy to modify)
- Django is also very affordable and lastly it is future friendly(Machine learning)

#### Future Plans:
This include adding a very comprehensive suite of tests for the application, real-time customer service app, brand based sorting of the products and lots of other exciting features.


#### How to install the Project:
First clone the project from the Github repo to your local computer  then open the project to the root directory and run

to create the virtual environment and install all the project dependencies that are needed.

#### How to use the Project:
